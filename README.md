# Visual Studio Code - Paledark Operator Theme
Shameless edit of Palenight Operator which looks slightly darker.

Specifically intended to work with the Operator Mono font, but should be fine with any font unless you don't like bits of your code being italicized.

Expect it to look similar to [https://github.com/whizkydee/vscode-material-palenight-theme](https://github.com/whizkydee/vscode-material-palenight-theme) just darker with maybe a few color tweaks.
